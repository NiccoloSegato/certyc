            <p>Our modus operandi provides for complete transparency on what are the evaluation criteria and the scoring scales, allowing us to issue partial and fair certifications.</p>
            <p>On this page you can find the evaluation criteria, benchmarks, methods and the necessary of each of our certifications. Clear and transparent, down to the smallest detail.</p>

                <h2>Gender Pay Gap Certification</h2>
                <div style="margin-top: 5px;"></div>
                <p>The gender pay gap certification process allows you to evaluate the differences that exist within your company in terms of the salary gap between different genders. This index is very important for employee equality and satisfaction.</p>
                <div style="margin-top: 15px;"></div>
                <h3>The topic in detail</h3>
                <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/infographs/womenmen/bloc-2d.html?lang=en" target="_blank"><i>Women earn on average 15 % less than men</i></a>
                <div style="margin-top: 15px;"></div>
                <h3>Evaluation criteria</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong><mark>Global equity report</mark></strong></p>
                        <p>General relationship between salaries of employees and managers</p>
                        <p><strong>Maximum rating:</strong> 50/100</p>
                        <p><strong>In short:</strong> arithmetic mean of the differences in wages between men and women of equal roles and duties, grouped by the latter, and by all categories.</p>
                        <p><strong>Algorithm:</strong> the average of all the salaries of men and women who cover the same role is calculated, a ratio is made and a decimal value > 0 is obtained. The same calculation is made with all the roles and tasks present in the company. Once these values have been obtained, the arithmetic average of all is carried out, thus obtaining the average ratio of global parity. (When making the report, always consider the female salary first).</p>
                        <p><strong>Rating scale:</strong> a result of 1 corresponds to 50 points in the final evaluation. 1 point is deducted from the total 50 for each thousandth of difference</p>
